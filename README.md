## About The Project

With this project, I've wanted to improve my knowledge using React.

Some of the features I've created are:

* In Tic-Tac-Toe, your moves are stored in a way you can go back whenever you want.
* You don't need to change the page to change the game, all the page is dynamically changed.
* You can play both on PC and cellphone.
* Generate different Sudokus, and you can get hints.

## Getting Started

Just try and play! https://tic-tac-sudoku.vercel.app/
